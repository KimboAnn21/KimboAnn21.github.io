        <div class="post-content">
          <p>If someone had told me a year ago the ride I'd experience, I'd never have believed them.
          But when I get an idea in my head I see it through.  It was working in the forensics DNA and cancer RNA labs that I started to truly grasp the impact coding has on our world.</p>
          <p>I stopped <em>everything</em> I was doing and drew a new path towards coding.  At the time I was the Lead RNA Extraction II Technician for a lab focused on Lung, Melanoma, and Prostate cancers.</p>
          <p>We were using half million dollar robots in an underperforming manner and that drove me crazy.  There was a year and a half waiting list for any code to be changed in our tiny lab and I thought that was unacceptable.
            I offered to learn, to take on the task of updating, qc'ing, and validating new code that would benefit the patients in turn-around time with results. This was vetoed again and again.  I decided to leave to pursue coding so I could make a difference, using computer science.</p>
