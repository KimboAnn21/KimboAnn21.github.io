Kim Grossman Resume

Work in progress of an interactive resume.  As time permits, I will add JavaScript and make the two pages interactive.  A database project and three.js project will be implemented inside the resume along with links and details about previous work that I have completed.  

Please enjoy poking around.  I received my Full Stack Web Development certificate in May of 2019 and I am learning as much as I can, as fast as I can.  I absolutely love coding and wish I had discovered it earlier.  However, I am so glad I've finally jumped into this world.
