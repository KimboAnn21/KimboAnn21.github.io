          <h3>Full Stack Web Development Certificate-May 2019-Helio</h3>
            <p>Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including ECMA6), React, Node.js,
              Express, MongoDB, Git, RESTful APIs, MySQL (PHP, also)</p>
          <h3>Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt Certificate-December 2015</h3>
          <p>Completed Green Belt project for Sorenson Forensics.  Brought all reagent QC's inhouse.
            Previously sent to external lab to be quality controlled.
            Designing and implementing the system to QC, inhouse,
            and maintain integrity of lab and results saves Sorenson thousands of dollars each month, to this day.</p>
          <h3>Bachelor of Science-Minor focus on Integrative Human Biology & Art</h3>
          <p>The University of Utah does not have a Forensics program so I had to improvise with my studies.
            I focused on physical anthropology, which is more the study of human biology and osteology (bones).
            I also focused on cellular biology (microbiology was also not taught at U of U at undergraduate level).
            Throughout my studies, I also took a great interest in art.
            If you could get a minor in art with a degree in Science, I would have that.
            I absolutely love design, I love the asthetics of design and the impact that has for a users experience.</p>
